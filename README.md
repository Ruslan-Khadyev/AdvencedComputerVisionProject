# Cats and Dogs breed classification and detection 

This project is related to the task of classifying and detecting objects. The breeds of pets (dogs and cats) will be classified.

Dataset is open. There are 200 images of 37 different cats and dogs breads. Each image has an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.
