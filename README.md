# Cats and Dogs breed classification and detection 

This project is related to the task of classifying and detecting objects task. The breeds of pets (dogs and cats) will be classified.

The dataset is open. There are 200 images of 37 different cats and dog breeds. Each image has an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel-level trimap segmentation.

The YOLO model is planned to be used in this project. The model will be specified later (after studying the relevant topic).

Approximate project plan:

```
1) Data studying
2) Data preprocessing
3) Model architecture development
4) Model creation
5) Learning stage
6) Hyperparameter tuning
7) Discussion of the results
```
